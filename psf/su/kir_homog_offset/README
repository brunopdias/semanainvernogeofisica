README for SUKDMIG2D					16 Feb 1994

This demo depends on the CWP Public domain software package
and the SU (seismic UNIX) package.


The program SUKDMIG2D implements Kirchhoff depth migration
on a synthetic data set. The traveltime tables are generated
by rayt2d

To run demo, type:
Unif2      to compute the v(x,z) velocity profile and view  it;
Rayt2d 	   to generate traveltime tables;
Synlv      to generated common-shot synthetic seismograms
Sukdmig2d  to migrate the synthetic seismograms
Xplot      view the synthetic data and migrated image (X-windows output)
